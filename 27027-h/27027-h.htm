<p><i>About this book.</i> Although the title indicates that the <a href="#CHRONICLE">Chronicle</a>
begins in 1089, it actually begins in 1189 with the reign of Richard
I, and ends in 1483 with the death of Edward IV. It is based on two
manuscripts, now in the British Library, written by anonymous scribes
in the 15th Century. It recounts events not only in the City of
London&mdash;such as the elections of Mayors and Sheriffs&mdash;but also in the
British Isles and France, covering battles, coronations, births and
deaths of prominent people, tempests, earthquakes, plagues, and other
noteworthy occurrences.</p>

<p>The Chronicle was first published in 1827, in a limited edition of 250
copies, with copious <a href="#NOTES">notes</a> and an extensive section of <a href="#ILLUSTRATIONS">illustrative
documents</a>. Although the editors of the 1827 edition are not named, the
British Library catalogue identifies them as Sir Nicholas Harris
Nicolas, G.C.M.G., and Edward Tyrrell (whose signature appears at the
end of the dedication).</p>

<p>This e-book was prepared from a 1995 reprint of the 1827 edition,
published by Llanerch Publishers, and from images of the 1827 edition
at the Internet Archive, www.archive.org.</p>

<p><i>Orthography.</i> The Chronicle section is written in 15th-Century
English. The original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and
hyphenation have been preserved in this e-book.</p>

<p>Numbers and dates in lowercase Roman numerals often end in a &#8220;j,&#8221;
signifying &#8220;i.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blank spaces in the text are represented by long dashes
(&mdash;&mdash;).</p>

<p><i>Formatting.</i> The Chronicle section of the original utilizes unique
page headers indicating the name of the monarch and the years covered
on that page, e.g., REX HENRICUS T&#8217;CIUS [1238-1242.]. These have been
retained in this e-book and inserted in the appropriate chronological
place.</p>

<p>The original contains numerous sidenotes. In the Chronicle section,
sidenotes marked with an asterisk were added by the editors and are
here treated as footnotes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="lgsmcap">This</span> Volume presents to your notice an early Chronicle of the great
Metropolis over which you preside.</p>

<p>The rising taste for literature, and particularly that part of it
relating to the History of your ancient City, which has lately been
evinced by you in the formation of a Library, as well as in the
private Collections made by several of your members on the same
subject, renders it probable that the publication of this Chronicle,
which has never before been printed, may not be deemed unacceptable.</p>

<p>Amongst the &#8220;<a href="#ILLUSTRATIONS">Illustrations</a>&#8221; will be found some interesting and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>important documents taken from the Archives of your
Corporation;&mdash;they give a faint idea of the valuable historical
information contained in your Records; and it may be hoped that these
specimens will induce you to follow the example set by the Great
Council of the Nation in printing the Parliamentary Records, and that
at no very distant period measures may be taken for the publication of
such of the documents in your possession as will illustrate the
History of England, and of the City of London.</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">PREFACE.</span></h2>

<hr class="narrow1" />
<hr class="narrow2" />

<p><span class="lgsmcap">The</span> present period is so distinguished for historical research, that
the publication of an English Chronicle, written in the fifteenth
century, will not it is presumed require any other prefatory remarks
to recommend it to attention, than a brief account of the MSS. from
which it has been transcribed. Two copies are extant in the British
Museum; the one in the Harleian MS. 565, the other in the Cottonian
MS. Julius B. <span class="smcap">i</span>. and the material variations between them are either
alluded to, or inserted in the Notes. The copy in the Harleian MS.
ends with the 22nd year of the reign of Henry the Sixth, Anno 1442,
about which time the volume was evidently written: but the other
transcript, which is in a much later hand, is continued to the death
of Edward the Fourth, Anno 1483, though after the accession of that
monarch the narrative is barren and unsatisfactory. It may therefore
be inferred that the original compiler did not survive the death of
Henry the Sixth, and that the continuation was by another person. With
the events of that period the writer is consequently to be deemed
contemporary; and all which he relates of the reigns of Henry the
Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth, are peculiarly deserving of notice; for some
curious facts are mentioned, many of which have never,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span> it is
believed, been so fully detailed, even if they were previously known;
whilst of earlier times his statements are as worthy of credit as
those of other Chroniclers who did not live in the ages of which they
respectively treat.</p>

<p>This volume is called &#8220;<span class="smcap">A Chronicle of London</span>&#8221; in the title-page, from
the author having so particularly confined himself to the Metropolis;
and still more, because he has, like his successor Fabian, commenced
each year with the election of the Lord Mayors and Sheriffs of London,
whose names are uniformly recorded, but unfortunately no clue exists
by which the name of the writer can be ascertained.</p>

<p>To the history of England however, no less than to that of London,
this Chronicle will, it is confidently expected, be considered a
valuable addition; and the laudable avidity evinced by the
Corporation, under whose patronage it appears, as well as by numerous
natives of the metropolis, to possess every work relating to its early
history, justifies the hope that by them at least it will be
favourably received.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the volume the following <a href="#ILLUSTRATIONS"><span class="smcap">Illustrations</span></a> are
introduced, the most important of which have, with the obliging
permission of Henry Woodthorpe, Esq. the Town Clerk, been copied from
the invaluable muniments in the City Archives.</p>

</div>

<p>The whole of these articles were written at the periods to which they
relate, and the greater part of them are for the first time printed;
whilst the few that have been before published, are inserted either
because more correct copies have been discovered, or because they are
so intimately connected with some of the others that they could not
with propriety be omitted.</p>

<p>Most of the pieces enumerated have escaped the notice of Historians;
and as they tend in an important degree to illustrate the Manners and
Customs of the Metropolis, their appearance in this volume cannot
fail, it is hoped, to be acceptable to those who are interested in the
early History of London or of this Kingdom.</p>

<p>In the Cottonian MS. under the <i>third</i> year of Hen. V., and when the
mayor and sheriffs mentioned in the text as serving in the 2nd Hen. V.
are stated to have held those offices, the king&#8217;s expedition is
properly noticed. This error cannot be explained in any other manner
than by attributing it to the transcriber; for it is notorious that
Henry quitted England, besieged and captured Harfleur, and fought the
battle of Agincourt, in the <i>third</i> year of his reign. The account of
that expedition is so differently related from that in the text, that
it is here given at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;The kyng with alle his hoste seiled over the see with ij m<span class="super">l</span>
shippis and mo; and the xvj day of August a litle from Harflete he
landid: and the Saturday next after thassumpcion of oure lady he leide
siege about Harflete, and contynued the sege unto the Sonday next
before the fest of seint Michel, upon which Sonday the towne of
Harflete was delyvered to the king, that was the xxij day of
Septembre. But it is to wite, that on Tuesday bifore, that was the
xvij day of Septembre, at xij of the belle wythynne nyght, the lordes
that were capteynes and governours of the towne, that is to sey the
lord Gaucourt, the lord Tutvill, and mo other lordes, senten out an
haraude of armes unto the duke of Clarence, praiyng him at the
reverence of God that he wolde send to the kyng, bisechyng hym that he
wolde of his high and gracious lordship, graunt them leve to trete
with what persones that the kyng wolde assigne to them. And the kyng
at the reverence of God, and at there request, assigned therle of
Dorset, the lord Fitz Hugh, and S<span class="super">r</span>. Thomas of Erpyngham, to here
what thei wolde desire. And thei desired that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span> the kyng wold not werre
upon them fro that houre at mydnyght, unto the Sonday next after the
fest of seint Michel; and but it were so that thei were rescued by
bataile of the Frensshe kyng or with the dolphyn by that day, thei to
yelde the towne to the kyng, and thei to have theire lives and goodes.
And the kyng sent them worde that if thei wolde delyver the towne on
the morwe next after the houre of mydnyght aforseid, without any
condicion, he wolde accepte it, and in any other wise he bad them seke
no trete. And yet the Frensshe lordes praied oure lordes to biseke the
kyng at the reverence of God and of oure lady, that he wolde graunte
them that same Tuesday nyght, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
and the Sonday til an houre after none: and in that meane tyme the
lordes that were capitayns of the towne, to come to the kyng with xxij
knyghts and squyers with them, of the moost sufficient men withyn the
towne, and thei to be sworen openly afore alle the people upon Goddis
body. But it so were that the Frensshe kyng or the dolphyn rescued
them by that Sonday, by the houre of none or anon after none, thei to
delyver the towne to the kyng, and alle there bodies and goodes to
done with them whatsoever him list, without eny condicion, with that
the kyng wolde suffre them to send to the Frensshe kyng viij persones
out of the towne, lettyng him wite in what plite thei stond: and they
graunted them. And upon the Wednesday by the morowe these lordes comen
out of the towne, and xxij knyghts with them; and come the procession
solempnely and stately, with xxiiij copis of a sute before Goddis
body, with many worshipful lordes, knyghts, and squyers, and other
moch multitude of people fro the kings tent, as solempnely done and as
stately as any man saugh ever such a thing done bifore that time; but
the kyng was not there present. And the Frenssh lordes there made
there othes upon the holy sacrament. And the othes thus done, the
Frensshe lordes with theire felauship were brought to the kyngs tents,
and there thei eten in the kyngs halle: but in all this tyme thei sawe
not the kyng. And when thei had eten, they were departid and delyvered
to certen lordes for to in hostage unto the Sonday at the houre after
none, as it was accordid whan thei received. And at the houre on
Sonday after none, the kyng had a tent pight on an hille bifore the
towne, and there he sate in his estate roial, and al his lordis about
hym; and than came the Frensshe lordes with iij<span class="super">xx</span> and iiij with
them, of the moost sufficient men that were withynne the towne, and to
the kyng in his propre persone yelded up the keies of the towne, and
there bodies and goodes to the kyngs grace without eny condicion: and
this was done the xxij day of Septembre, the yere of oure lord m<span class="super">l</span>
iiij<span class="super">c</span> xv. And anon after that, the kyng ostered from thens xxj
daies thurgh the realme of Fraunce, fro Harflete toward Caleys; and
the Friday, that is to sey the day of the holy seints Crispyn and
Crispinian, alle the roial power of Fraunce, excepte the Frenssh kyng,

embatailed in iij batailes, to the nombre of lx m<span class="super">l</span> men of armes,
and the fairist armed men that eny man saugh ever in any place. And
the kyng seyng wele that thei wolde not suffre hym to passe withouten

letten us of oure wey; and if thei wol com to us, let every man preve

men of armes went upon theire fete a fast paas in holle arraie, an
Englisshe myle er thei assemblid. And thrugh the grace of God the kyng
made his heigh wey thrugh the thikkest prees of alle the bataile. And

In which cross, in the year of our Lord one thousand cccxxxix, on the

Magdalene, many precious reliques of several saints were deposited
with great solemnity of procession, for the preservation of the same

through the glorious merits of all the saints whose reliques are
contained in that cross, might deign to preserve them from tempest and
peril under his protection. Of whose mercy to all the xxvij procuring
succour to the fabric of this church, cl days are set apart at every

<h3>A COPY OF THE GREAT TABLET HANGING IN THE SAME PLACE, BY THE SAID TOMB
OF THE SAID ROGER LATELY BISHOP OF LONDON.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The ages of the world.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the beginning God created the heaven and earth and all things which
are in them. But on the sixth day from the creation of the world, was
made the first-formed Adam. <span class="sidenote">1.</span>The first age of the world, from Adam to
Noeh according to the Hebrews, contains a thousand, six hundred and
fifty six years; according to the Seventy Interpreters, two thousand
two hundred xliiij years. But according to Jerome not completely two
thousand; according to Metodus two thousand. The cause of which
diversity is, that these do not compute according to the manner of
sacred Scripture the minuti&aelig; of times, or of years, which are over and
above the thousands and hundreds of years. From the beginning of the
world until Noeh&#8217;s flood, are two thousand two hundred fifty six
years. <span class="sidenote">2.</span>The second age from Noeh until Abraham, contains according to
the Seventy Interpreters, a thousand and seventy two years: according
to the Hebrews, a thousand two hundred and twenty two years. <span class="sidenote">3.</span>The third
age from Abraham until David, contains according to the Hebrews, eight
hundred and xl two years; but according to the Seventy Interpreters
much less, since they are deficient by two years. <span class="sidenote">4.</span>The fourth age from
David until the carrying away captive into Babylon, contains according
to the Hebrews, four hundred and seventy three years; according to the
Seventy Interpreters little less, for they are deficient in one year.
<span class="sidenote">5.</span>The fifth age, from the carrying away captive into Babylon, until
Christ, contains five hundred and eighty five years. According to
others, five hundred and ninety years. <span class="sidenote">6.</span>The sixth age is from Christ
until the end of the world. The years from the beginning of the world
until the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, are five thousand
ninety nine. The years from the incarnation of the same until his
passion, thirty three incomplete. The years from the creation of the
world until the destruction of Troy, iiij m<span class="super">l</span> xxx years. From the
destruction of Troy until the erection of new Troy, which is now
called London, lxiiij years. From the erection of new Troy to the
erection of the Roman city, ccclxxxx years. From the building of the
city until the coming of Christ, dcc.xv years. From the beginning of
the world iiij m<span class="super">l</span> lxxxxiiij years, after the destruction of Troy,
namely, in the mc and fifth year before the incarnation of Christ;
Brutus, a certain noble person sprung of the Trojan race, with a great
multitude of Trojans, through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span> response of the goddess Diana,
entered into the island formerly called Albion and inhabited by
giants; and destroyed all the giants, amongst whom was one very
mighty, by name Gogmagog; and he called that land after his own name
Britain. Afterwards by the Saxons or Angles that conquered it, it was
called England. And the same Brutus the first king of the Britons
constructed the first city of Britain, which is now called London, in
remembrance of the Troy before destroyed, calling it Trinovantum, that
is new Troy, which for a long time was called Trinovans. Ely the
priest was then reigning in Judea, and the ark of the testimony
captured by the Philistines. After the death of Brutus there reigned
in Britain lviij kings. Afterwards reigned king Lud, who strongly
built the walls of the city of the Trinovantes, which was by him
called Caerlud, in English <span class="smcap">Loudesdon</span>, and surrounded it with
innumerable towers; which he loved above all the cities of the realm,
and therefore directed that they should build houses and edifices,
which should surpass the buildings of other cities. At his death his
corpse was most nobly laid up in the aforesaid city near the gate
which he himself built, and was called from his name <span class="smcap">Ludesgate</span>. At
length the English called it <span class="smcap">Londene</span>: afterwards the Normans called it
<span class="smcap">Loundres</span> which in Latin is called Londonia. After the death of Lud
reigned Cassibellanus his brother, namely, in the lviij<span class="super">th</span> year
before Christ&#8217;s incarnation; in whose time came Julius Cesar into
Britain with a copious multitude, and being twice overcome and routed
and driven off, the third time being recalled into Britain, he, by the
aid of Androgeus duke of Kent, made it tributary to the Roman power.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Verses.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Whosoever thou art: if thou wishest to know the English kings or
laws, thou wilt read by perusing these. I will record the greater or
nobler kings; when they reigned, and where the people buried them.
Four thousand and a score years was Adam made before Brutus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brutus in the xv<span class="super">th</span> year of his age departing from Italy, arriving
at the island Leogecia in his ship, consulted there Diana, saying:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Words of Brutus: Verses.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;O mighty Goddess of the woods, terror of the wild boars, who hast
power to pass through ethereal space and the infernal abodes: unfold
earthly fate; and say what lands thou wishest us to inhabit; Tell also
the dwelling in which I shall venerate thee for ever; in which I shall
consecrate temples to thee with virgin dances.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Reply of Diana.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Brutus, under the setting sun, beyond the Gallic realms, there is an
island in the ocean all inclosed by sea; there is an island in the
ocean, once inhabited by giants, now indeed desert, fit for thy
tribes. This seek, for it shall be to thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span> a perpetual abode; Hence
shall arise another Troy to thy sons; Here from thine offspring shall
Kings be born, and to them shall all the earth be subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brutus, comforted with such a reply, and having prepared a fleet,
steered with his people into the Island Albion which is now called
England, and began to reign therein, in the xxxv<span class="super">th</span> year of his age;

of a curious Poem preserved in the archives of the Corporation of the
City of London, in the MS. entitled <i>Liber Custumarium</i>, fol. 84; from
which it has been extracted by the obliging permission of Henry
Woodthorpe, Esq. the Town Clerk. The leaf which contained the
concluding stanzas has been lost; but judging from the number of those
which remain, it originally consisted of about nine more verses. It is
written in the hand of the period in which the events to which it
alludes took place, and as the documents in the volume from which it
is copied end in the succeeding reign, there is every reason to
presume that it was entered in the Records of the City of London
within a short period after it was composed. Every line of each verse
contains the same letter in the middle of the line, and every line
ends with the same letter: these two letters are placed in the middle
and at the end of each verse, separated from the words to which they
belong, but connected with them by lines in the manner in which the
first verse of the Poem is here printed, and which has been considered
sufficient to show the singular manner in which it was originally
written.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>Of the conduct which caused Sir Thomas Turbeville&#8217;s execution, the
following fragment of a curious contemporary poem in the Cottonian MS.
<i>Caligula</i> A. xviij, presents perhaps the most accurate information
which is extant. It immediately precedes, and is written in the same
hand as, the only <i>contemporary</i> copy of the Roll of Carlaverock which
is known to exist, and hence it is highly probable that it was
composed by the same person. Under any circumstances, however, it
cannot fail to be deemed to possess sufficient interest to render it a
valuable illustration to the passage in the text.</p>

the attention of Historians, presents an authentic detail of that
memorable event; and it is evident from it that Robert de Avesbury,
the contemporary writer upon whom the greatest reliance has hitherto
been placed, has fallen into some errors in his narrative of the
transaction. He informs us that on the day after the battle a rumour
of it reached London, but that it was discredited until the ensuing
Wednesday, namely the 28th of June, when the Prince of Wales received
a letter from the king informing him of his success, of which letter
that writer asserts that the annexed was a copy:</p>

<p>It is however manifest from that document having been tested by the
Prince of Wales, that it was rather a proclamation issued in
consequence of the dispatch from the king to the prince, than the
dispatch itself, of which the letter now for the first time printed
may be deemed the only copy which is extant. Nor must it be forgotten
that the date affixed to the article given by Avesbury tends to excite
a suspicion of its authenticity; for it is tested by the prince at
Waltham Holy Cross upon the precise day, the 28th of June, on which
the king&#8217;s letter was written, and which could not therefore possibly
have arrived on the day in question at Waltham. It is somewhat
singular that as the battle was concluded on the 25th of June, the
king should not have written until the 28th; but this may perhaps be
accounted for by those arrangements which his success would
necessarily have required, and which may be supposed to have engaged
the monarch&#8217;s whole attention for some days. The letter in Avesbury&#8217;s
Annals gives no particulars of the battle, though that writer relates
that the enemy were beaten; that more than thirty thousand of them
were slain; that many leapt into the sea from fear and were drowned;
and that their fleet consisted of two hundred large ships, on board of
one of which four hundred dead bodies were found. The Royal dispatch,
however, affords much more minute information, and corrects the
statements both in Avesbury and in the preceding Chronicle. It asserts
that the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span> fleet amounted to one hundred and eighty sail; that
they were nobly defended the whole of a day and a night; that they
were all captured in the engagement excepting twenty-four which took
to flight, and part of them were subsequently taken at sea; that the
number of the men at arms and other armed persons amounted to
thirty-five thousand, of whom five thousand escaped; that the English
ships captured by the French at Middleburgh were then retaken; and
that among the prizes were three or four as large as &#8217;the
Christopher,&#8217; which we may infer was then the largest ship of the
English navy.</p>

<p>It is unquestionable from what has been said, that this document
supplies some important facts in the history of the times, whilst its
entry among the Records of the City of London tends to establish that
the Mayor of the city was accustomed at that early period to receive
an official account of every public transaction, and of which another
example will be found in a subsequent page.</p>

<p>The events which led to the battle of the Swyne, or as it is more
generally termed of the Scluse, are too familiar to require
repetition.</p>

<p><a name="ILLUS_4" id="ILLUS_4"></a><a href="#Page_63">P. 63</a>. &#8220;And in this yere, that is to seye the yere of oure lord a
m<span class="super">l</span> ccclvj<span class="super">to</span>, the xix day of Septembre, kyng John of Fraunce was

<p>It would be difficult to name a more interesting document connected
with English History than that by which, through the courtesy of Henry
Woodthorpe, Esq., Town Clerk of the City of London, the passage in the
text will be illustrated; namely, a copy of the letter from Edward the
Black Prince to the Mayor, Aldermen and Comonalty of London,
acquainting them with the achievement of the battle of Poictiers. This
important record, which has never before been printed, occurs among
the archives of the city, in a contemporary MS. entitled Letter G.
fol. 53<span class="super">b</span>. and was, there can be little doubt, entered into that
volume soon after the receipt of the original.</p>

<p>The greater part of the Prince&#8217;s letter is occupied by the detail of
the proceedings of the army for some days previous to the battle, and
in describing the efforts of the Cardinal Peregort to produce a peace
or truce between the kings of France and England; whilst the conflict
itself is mentioned in a few words. Independently of the particulars
of the English forces and their rencontres with the enemy which this
letter so minutely relates, its most important statement is that of
the precise day when the battle took place, for historians have
differed materially upon the point. The Prince, however, expressly
says that it occurred on the eve of the feast of St. Matthew, i.e. the
20th of September. His letter was dated at Bordeaux on the 22nd of the
following month, and was sent to the Mayor of London by the Prince&#8217;s
chamberlain Sir Neel Loring; and the manner in which he refers the
Mayor and Citizens to that distinguished knight for further
information, cannot fail to be noticed, from its great similarity to
the conclusion of a modern military dispatch. Another feature of this
and other documents of the same nature in early periods, is the great
simplicity and modesty with which they are written. An expression of
gratitude to God alone interrupts the unadorned narrative; and the
defeat of an army infinitely superior in numbers, and the capture of
one of the most powerful sovereigns of the times together with his
eldest son, are thus laconically related: &#8220;The battle took place on
the eve of St. Matthew; and, praise be to God, the enemy were
discomfited, and the king and his son were taken, and great numbers of
other people taken and slain.&#8221; To present as many contemporary
documents as could be collected relative to this memorable event, two
other letters are introduced, as well as the affidavit of an
individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span> who claimed to have been the person to whom king John of
France surrendered himself.</p>

<p>One of the letters alluded to, which is printed in the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>,
vol. i. p. 213, is also from the Black Prince, to Reginald Bryan
bishop of Worcester, dated at Bordeaux on the 20th of November,
briefly informing him of his success, which he attributes in a great
measure to the efficacy of that prelate&#8217;s prayers.</p>

<p>The other letter is from Robert Prite to some English nobleman, dated
on the 8th of December 1356, whose clerk, or probably priest, he
styles himself, and is taken from the original on vellum in the
Cottonian MS. Caligula D. III. f. 33. After mentioning the battle of
Poictiers, the particulars of which he says he will learn from a
knight whom the duke of Lancaster had sent into England to the king,
the writer acquaints him with some other news of the time, as well as
with what had occurred in some of his towns; and entreats him to come
over as soon as possible. This letter, which is now for the first time
printed, though not so important as the others, is nevertheless of
interest, as connected with the battle of Poictiers, and with other
public and private transactions of the period.</p>

<p>The third document on the subject is the solemn declaration of Bernard
du Troy, a Gascon gentleman, made on his death-bed the 1st of July
1361, that he was the person who took the king of France prisoner at
the battle of Poictiers; which point it is evident from this
instrument, as well as from historians, had been much disputed. This
very curious article, which also occurs in the Cottonian MS. just
mentioned, is highly interesting; for it not only shows who were the
claimants to the honour of having captured the king, but the ardour
with which that claim was supported. It is however doubtful whether
the love of fame or pecuniary interest prompted this declaration at so
awful a moment; but his motive, like those of most other human
actions, was probably of a mixed nature; for whatever might be the
renown which was attached to the exploit, the ransom to which the true
claimant would be entitled must have been an object of great
consideration to him or to his heirs. Du Troy carefully provides, that
those who would support his pretensions with their swords should
partake of the benefits which might arise from their valour; and this
circumstance presents a curious picture of the manners of the age. Sir
Denys de Morbeque of whom he speaks, is thus noticed by Froissart.
&#8220;There was much pressing at this time through eagerness of taking the
king: and those that were nearest to him, and knew him, cried out
&#8216;Surrender yourself, surrender yourself, or you are a dead man.&#8217; In
that part of the field was a young knight from St. Omer, who was
engaged by a salary in the service of the king of England: his name
was Denis de Morbeque, who for five years had attached himself to the
English, on account of having been banished in his younger days from
France for a murder committed in an affray at St. Omer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span> It
fortunately happened for this knight, that he was at the time near to
the king of France when he was so much pulled about. He by dint of
force, for he was very strong and robust, pushed through the crowd and
said to the king in good French, &#8216;Sire, sire, surrender yourself.&#8217; The
king, who found himself very disagreeably situated, turning to him,
asked &#8216;To whom shall I surrender myself; to whom? Where is my cousin
the Prince of Wales? if I could see him I would speak to him.&#8217; &#8216;Sire,&#8217;
replied Sir Denys, &#8216;he is not here; but surrender yourself to me, and
I will lead you to him.&#8217; &#8216;Who are you?&#8217; said the king. &#8216;Sire, I am
Denys de Morbeque, a knight from Artois, but I serve the king of
England because I cannot belong to France, having forfeited all I
possessed there.&#8217; The king then gave him his right-hand glove, and
said &#8216;I surrender myself to you.&#8217; There was much crowding and pushing
about, for every one was eager to cry out &#8216;I have taken him.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of the witnesses to Du Troy&#8217;s declaration were celebrated peers
and knights both of England and France.</p>

<p>The rebellion noticed in the text is so important an event in the
history of England as well as of the Metropolis, that no apology can
be required for the insertion of an inedited document in any degree
connected with it. In the <i>F&#339;dera</i>, tom. vii. are several
proclamations on the same subject, and among them one tested at London
on the 15<span class="super">th</span> June 1381, directed to the sheriff of Kent; but the
following, dated at Chelmsford on the 5<span class="super">th</span> of July in that year, has
never, it is believed, been printed. It appears from it that the
rebels had asserted that they were supported by the king&#8217;s authority;
and His Majesty therefore, not merely denies the fact, but commands
the earl of Warwick and the other persons in that county to whom the
instrument is addressed, to use every possible effort to suppress the
disturbance of the public peace, in places under their jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="ILLUS_8" id="ILLUS_8"></a>In pp. <a href="#Page_99">99-102</a>, as well as in pp. <a href="#Page_157">157-159</a>, an account is given of Henry
the Fifth&#8217;s expedition into France in the year 1415, and of the battle
of Agincourt. In the Harleian MS. N<span class="super">o</span> 565, from which the preceding
Chronicle was transcribed, the following Poem occurs on the same
subject, a correct copy of which has never been published, though at
the end of Hearne&#8217;s edition of Elmham&#8217;s Life of Henry the Fifth, a
poem is inserted so very similar to the annexed that it may be
presumed to have been taken from another copy of the same. It is said
to have been transcribed from the Cottonian MS. Vitellius D. <span class="smcap">xii</span>.,
which is not now extant: but upon collating this piece with the one
printed by Hearne, it appears, after allowing for the various readings
which frequently occur in different copies of an early poem, that many
words were erroneously given by that zealous antiquary.
Notwithstanding that it possesses but little claim to poetical merit,
it is highly curious, from its being nearly if not quite contemporary
with the events which it relates; for there can be no doubt of its
having been a production of the prolific pen of that &#8220;drivelling
monk,&#8221; as he has been severely termed, the monk of Bury, John Lydgate,
several of whose other pieces, from their presenting a faithful but
rude picture of the manners and transactions of the times, are also
inserted in this volume. The garrulous monk, in the article which is
the subject of these remarks, particularly notices every circumstance
in which the Mayor and Citizens of the Metropolis were concerned, and
hence it is an appropriate illustration of a &#8220;<span class="smcap">Chronicle of London</span>.&#8221; It
is worthy of observation, that the story of the tennis-balls having
been sent as a satirical present from the Dauphin to Henry the Fifth,
and to which Shakspeare alludes, is frequently mentioned in the poem,
and furnishes the writer with several metaphors.</p>

<p>But besides the historical information with which the poem abounds,
and which is corroborated by the best authorities, it cannot fail to
be considered of much interest, from the description of the
magnificent reception of the king into London, after his return from
France.</p>

yere, the xvj day of Decembre, G beynge the dominical lettre, kyng
Herry the vj<span class="super">te</span> was crowned kyng of Fraunce at Parys, in the chirche
of Notre Dame, with gret solempnite and rialte; and anoon after he

<p>The following poem by Lydgate presents a very minute account of the
manner in which the young monarch was received into London after his
coronation as king of France, and of the pageant upon the occasion.
Two copies exist in MS. in the British Museum; one in the Harleian MS.
565, which has been literally transcribed; the other in the Cottonian
MS. Julius B. II; and the variations between them will be found in the
notes. About one third of this article, taken from the former of those
MSS., is printed in Malcolm&#8217;s London, vol. ii. p. 89, but it conveys a
very imperfect idea of the whole composition; for not only has the
orthography of the extract been modernized, but the most interesting
descriptions do not occur. The annexed is therefore, it is presumed,
the only correct copy which has ever been published, and it cannot
fail to be deemed an exceedingly curious illustration of the passage
in &#8220;The Chronicle,&#8221; as well as of the manners of the period. Lydgate
does not mention upon what day of the month the circumstance took
place, but says that it was &#8220;upon a Thorsday&#8221; &#8220;toward the ende of
wyndy Februarie:&#8221; and as the 21st of February in 1431 fell on a
Thursday, there is little doubt that it was on that day that Henry
entered London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>The temporary reconciliation between the adherents of the King and of
the Duke of York, so briefly alluded to in the text, and which is best
illustrated by the following extract from a contemporary letter,
served, like every other event of his times, for the exercise of
Lydgate&#8217;s pen; but his description of it in the following ballad is
infinitely more valuable from its historical accuracy, than its
poetical merit. Of this article there are two copies extant; one in
the Cottonian MS. Nero A. <span class="smcap">vi</span>. and the other in the Cottonian MS.
Vespasianus B. <span class="smcap">xvi</span>.: the latter copy has been printed, though very
erroneously, and with the orthography modernized, by Mr. Sharon
Turner; but the former has not been before noticed. As they differ in
some places from each other, and are very short, it has been thought
advisable that both transcripts should be inserted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>Neither of the ensuing articles, the whole of which are the production
of the indefatigable Lydgate, can possibly be assigned to its proper
date; and they are therefore arranged in the following order.</p>

<p class="hang">1. <i>A Balade sent by a Poursyant to the Shirreves of London,
acompanyed with theire Bretherne upon Mayes Daye, at Busshopes Wod, at
an honurable Dyner, ech of them bringginge his Dysshe.</i></p>

<p>This Ballad, which occurs in Ashmole&#8217;s Collection of Manuscripts, is
introduced from its having been addressed to the Sheriffs of London;
but it contains little that is worthy of attention.</p>

<p class="hang">2. <i>London Lickpenny.</i></p>

<p>Of the numerous Ballads composed by &#8217;The Monk of Bury,&#8217; this is
perhaps the most curious and the best known; and, from its presenting
a great deal of information relative to the Metropolis in the
fifteenth century, it is of considerable interest. Two copies exist in
MS. in the British Museum; one in the Harleian MS. 367, which is
printed in Noorthouck&#8217;s and Dr. Pugh&#8217;s History of London, as well as
in several other works; the other, in Stow&#8217;s hand-writing, in the
Harleian MS. 542: and as they differ very materially from each other,
a copy of each is inserted. To this Ballad, it has been thought right
to add another, by the same writer, which has never been before
printed, on a very similar subject; namely,</p>

<p class="hang">3. <i>Upon the Emptiness of his Purse,&mdash;</i></p>

<p>In which he treats this, perhaps the greatest of all human
misfortunes, since it prevents the alleviation of almost all others,
with singular address. The subject seems to have been a favourite one
with our early poets; for there is a Ballad with nearly the same title
by Chaucer; and another is printed in &#8217;The Boke of St. Albans.&#8217;</p>

<p class="hang">4. <i>On Forked Head Dresses.</i></p>

<p>The head-dresses of females in the reign of Henry the Sixth closely
resembled the <i>cauchoises</i> still worn by those of Normandy; and which
excited the displeasure of Dan John in so great a degree as to have
induced him to invoke the aid of his Muse in effecting their
abolition. It seems no subject escaped that eternal scribbler&#8217;s
attention; and if his abilities had equalled his disposition, he would
probably have become the Juvenal of his age. Upon this occasion,
however, he appears to have soared on rather a higher wing than usual;
and the moral of his lay is the truism which has since been so
beautifully expressed, that loveliness</p>

<p class="center">
&#8220;Is when unadorn&#8217;d, adorn&#8217;d the most.&#8221;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p class="hang">5. <i>On Fraudulent Millers and Bakers.</i></p>

<p>This short Ballad would appear, from the following passage in Fabian&#8217;s
Chronicle, to have been written in the 15th of Edw. IV. A<span class="super">o</span> 1475, if
it were not, that though the date of Lydgate&#8217;s death has never been
precisely ascertained, yet it is scarcely possible he could have lived
to that year.</p>

<p>&#8220;This yere this mayer [Robert Bassett] dyd sharpe correccion upon
bakers, for makynge of lyght brede; in so moche thatt he sett dyverse
upon the pillory,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>A similar circumstance might however have occurred some years before,
notwithstanding that it is not noticed by the writers of the period.</p>

<p class="poem">
In London ther I was lent,<br />
I saw myselfe where trouthe shuld be ateynte;<br />
Fast to Westminstar ward I went,<br />
To a man of lawe to make my complaynt;<br />
I sayd for Maris love, that holy seynt,<br />
Have pity on the powre that would procede;<br />
I would gyve sylvar, but my purs is faynt,<br />
For lacke of money I may not spede.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span><br />
<br />
As I thrast thrughe out the thronge,<br />
Among them all my hode was gonn;<br />
Netheles I let not longe,<br />
To Kyngs benche tyll I come;<br />
Byfore a juge I knelyd anon,<br />
I prayd hym for Gods sake he would take hede;<br />
Full rewfully to hym I gan make my mone,<br />
For lacke of money I may not spede.<br />
<br />
Benethe hym set clerks a great rowt,<br />
Fast they writen by one assent;<br />
There stode up one and cryed round about,<br />
Richard, Robert, and one of Kent:<br />
I wist not wele what he ment,<br />
He cried so thike there indede,<br />
There were stronge theves shamed and shent,<br />
But they that laked money mowght not spede.<br />
<br />
Unto the Comon place y yowde thoo,<br />
Where sat one with a sylker houde;<br />
I dyd hym reverence as me ought to do;<br />
I tolde hym my case as well as I coude,<br />
And sayd all my goods by nowrd and by sowde,<br />
I am defrawdyd with great falshed;<br />
He would not geve me a momme of his mouthe,<br />
For lake of money I may not spede.<br />
<br />
Then I went me unto the Rollis,<br />
Before the clerks of the Chauncerie;<br />
There were many qui tollis,<br />
But I herd no man speke of me;<br />
Before them I knelyd upon my kne,<br />
Shewyd them myne evedence, and they began to reade.<br />
They seyde trewer thinge might there nevar be,<br />
But for lacke of money I may not spede.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span><br />
<br />
In Westminster hall I found one,<br />
Went in a longe gown of ray;<br />
I crowched and kneled before them anone,<br />
For Marys love of helpe I gan them pray;<br />
As he had be wrothe, he voyded away,<br />
Bakward his hand he gan me byd,<br />
I wot not what thow menest gan he say,<br />
Ley downe sylvar, or here thow may not spede.<br />
<br />
In all Westminstar hall I could find nevar a one,<br />
That for me would do, thowghe I shuld dye;<br />
Without the dores were Flemings grete woon;<br />
Upon me fast they gan to cry,<br />
And sayd, Mastar, what will ye cepen or by?<br />
Fine felt hatts, spectacles for to rede;<br />
Of this gay gere a great cawse why,<br />
For lake of money I might not spede.<br />
<br />
Then to Westminster gate y went,<br />
When the sone was at highe prime;<br />
Cokes to me, they toke good entent,<br />
Called me nere, for to dyne,<br />
And proferyd me good brede, ale, and wyne;<br />
A fayre clothe they began to sprede,<br />
Rybbes of beffe bothe fat and fine;<br />
But for lacke of money I might not spede.<br />
<br />
In to London I gan me hy;<br />
Of all the lond it bearethe the prise,<br />
Hot pescods, one gan cry,<br />
Strabery rype, and chery in the ryse;<br />
One bad me come nere and by some spice,<br />
Pepar, and saffron, they gan me bede,<br />
Clove, grayns, and flowre of rise;<br />
For lacke of money I might not spede.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span><br />
<br />
Then into Chepe I gan me drawne,<br />
Where I sawe stond moche people;<br />
One bad me come nere, and by fine cloth of lawne,<br />
Paris thred coton and umple;<br />
I seyd there upon I could no skyle,<br />
I am not wont there to in dede,<br />
One bad me by an hewre my hed to hele;<br />
For lake of money I might not spede.<br />
<br />
Then went I forth by London stone,<br />
Thrught out all Canywike strete;<br />
Drapors to me they called anone,<br />
Grete chepe of clothe they gan me hete;<br />
Then come ther one, and cried hot shepes fete;<br />
Risshes faire and grene, anothar began to grede,<br />
Bothe melwell and makarell I gran mete;<br />
But for lacke of money I myght not spede.<br />
<br />
Then I hied me into Est Chepe;<br />
One cries ribes of befe, and many a pie;<br />
Pewtar potts they clatteryd or a heape;<br />
Ther was harpe, pipe, and sawtry;<br />
Ye by cokke, nay by cokke, some began to cry;<br />
Some sang of Jenken and Julian, to get themselves mede;<br />
Ful fayne I wold hadd of that mynstralsie,<br />
But for lacke of money I cowld not spede.<br />
<br />
Into Cornhill anon I yede,<br />
Where is moche stolne gere amonge;<br />
I saw wher henge myne owne hode,<br />
That I had lost in Westminstar amonge the throng;<br />
Then I beheld it with lokes full longe,<br />
I kenned it as well as I dyd my crede,<br />
To be myne owne hode agayne; me thought it wrong,<br />
But for lacke of money I might not spede.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span><br />
<br />
Then came the Taverner, and toke me by the sleve,<br />
And seyd Ser, a pint of wyn would yow assay?<br />
Syr, qwod I, it may not greve,<br />
For a peny may do no more then it may:<br />
I dranke a pint, and therefore gan pay;<br />
Sore a hungred away I yede,<br />
For well London lykke peny for ones eye,<br />
For lake of money I may not spede.<br />
<br />
Then I hyed me to Byllingesgate,<br />
And cried wagge wagge gow hens;<br />
I praye a barge man, for Gods sake,<br />
That they would spare me myn expens;<br />
He sayde, ryse up, man, and get the hens,<br />
What menist thow, I will do on the no almes dede,<br />
Here scapeth no man byneth ij pens,<br />
For lacke of money I myght not spede.<br />
<br />
Then I conveyed me into Kent;<br />
For of the law would I medle no more,<br />
By caus no man to me would take entent,<br />
I dight me to the plowe even as I did before.<br />
Thus save London that in Bethelem was bore,<br />
And every trew man of law God graunt hymsels med,<br />
And they that be othar, God theyr state restore;<br />
For he that lacketh money with them he shall not spede.<br />

<h3>LONDON LYCKPENY.</h3>

<h4>A BALLADE COMPYLED BY DAN JOHN LYDGATE MONKE OF BERY, ABOUT &mdash;&mdash; YERES
AGOE, AND NOW NEWLY OVERSENE AND AMENDED.</h4>

<p class="center">[<i>Harleian MSS.</i> 367, f. 126, 127.]</p>

<p class="poem">
To London once, my stepps I bent,<br />
Where trouth in no wyse should be faynt:<br />
To Westmynster ward I forthwith went,<br />
To a man of law to make complaynt.<br />
I sayd, for Mary&#8217;s love that holy saynt,<br />
Pity the poore that would proceede;<br />
But for lack of mony I cold not spede.<br />
<br />
And as I thrust the prese amonge,<br />
By froward chaunce my hood was gone;<br />
Yet for all that I stayd not longe,<br />
Tyll at the kynge bench I was come.<br />
Before the judge I kneled anon,<br />
And prayd hym for Gods sake to take heede;<br />
But for lack of money I myght not spede.<br />
<br />
Beneth them sat clarkes a great rout,<br />
Which fast dyd wryte by one assent;<br />
There stoode up one and cryed about,<br />
Rychard, Robert, and John of Kent;<br />
I wyst not wele what this man ment:<br />
He cryed so thycke there indede,<br />
But he that lackt mony myght not spede.<br />
<br />
Unto the common place I yode thoo,<br />
Where sat one with a sylken hoode;<br />
I dyd hym reverence, for I ought to do so,<br />
And told my case as well as I coud,<br />
How my goods were defrauded me by falshood.<br />
I gat not a mum of his mouth for my meed,<br />
And for lack of mony I myght not spede.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span><br />
<br />
Unto the Rolls I gat me from thence,<br />
Before the clarkes of the chauncerye,<br />
Where many I found earnyng of pence,<br />
But none at all once regarded mee:<br />
I gave them my playnt uppon my knee;<br />
They lyked it well when they had it reade,<br />
But lackyng mony I could not be sped.<br />
<br />
In Westmynster hall I found out one,<br />
Which went in a long gown of raye;<br />
I crouched and kneled before hym anon:<br />
For Maryes love, of help I hym praye.<br />
I wot not what thou meanest, gan he say;<br />
To get me thence he dyd me bede,<br />
For lack of mony I cold not speed.<br />
<br />
Within this hall, neithere ryche nor yett poor,<br />
Wold do for me ought, although I shold dye;<br />
Which seing, I gat me out of the doore,<br />
Where Flemynge began on me for to cry,<br />
Master, what will you copen or by,<br />
Fyne felt hatts, or spectacles to reede?<br />
Lay down your sylver, and here you may spede.<br />
<br />
Then to Westmynster gate I presently went,<br />
When the sonn was at hyghe pryme;<br />
Cokes to me, they tooke good entent,<br />
And profered me bread with ale and wyne,<br />
Rybbs of befe both fat and ful fyne;<br />
A fayre cloth they gan for to sprede,<br />
But wantyng mony I might not be speede.<br />
<br />
Then unto London I dyd me hye,<br />
Of all the land it beareth the pryse;<br />
Hot pescods one began to crye,<br />
Straberry rype, and cherryes in the ryse:<br />
One bad me come nere, and by some spyce,<br />
Peper, and sayforne, they gan me bede;<br />
But for lacke of money I myght not spede.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span><br />
<br />
Then to the Chepe I began me drawne,<br />
Where mutch people I sawe for to stande;<br />
One ofred me velvet, sylke, and lawne,<br />
An other he taketh me by the haunde,<br />
Here is Parys thred, the fynest in the launde.<br />
I never was used to such thyngs in dede,<br />
And wanting mony I myght not spede.<br />
<br />
Then went I forth by London stone,<br />
Throughout all Canwyke streete;<br />
Drapers mutch cloth me offred anone:<br />
Then comes me one, cryd hot shepes feete,<br />
One cryde makerell, ryshes grene, another gan greete,<br />
One bad me by a hood to cover my head;<br />
But fore want of mony I myght not be sped.<br />
<br />
Then I hyed me into Estchepe;<br />
One cryes rybbs of befe, and many a pye;<br />
Pewter potts they clattered on a heape,<br />
There was harpe, pype, and mynstrelsye;<br />
Yea by cock, nay by cock, some began crye,<br />
Some songe of Jenken and Julyan for there mede;<br />
But for lack of mony I myght not spede.<br />
<br />
Then into Cornhyll anon I yode,<br />
Where was much stolen gere amonge;<br />
I saw where honge myne owne hoode,<br />
That I had lost amonge the thronge;<br />
To by my own hood I thought it wronge,<br />
I knew it well as I dyd my crede;<br />
But for lack of mony I could not spede.<br />
<br />
The Taverner took mee by the sleve;<br />
Sir, sayth he, wyll you our wyne assay?<br />
I answerd, that can not mutch me greve,<br />
A peny can do no more than it may:<br />
I dranke a pynt, and for it dyd pay;<br />
Yet sore a hungerd from thence I yede,<br />
And wantyng my mony I cold not spede.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span><br />
<br />
Then hyed I me to Belyngsgate;<br />
And one cryed hoo, go we hence;<br />
I prayd a barge man for Gods sake,<br />
That he wold spare me my expence.<br />
Thou scapst not here, quod he, under ij pence,<br />
I lyst not yet bestow my almes dede:<br />
Thus lacking mony I could not speede.<br />
<br />
Then I convayed me into Kent;<br />
For of the law wold I meddle no more,<br />
Because no man to me tooke entent,<br />
I dyght me to do as I dyd before.<br />
Now Jesus that in Bethlem was bore,<br />
Save London, and send trew lawyers there mede,<br />
For who so wants mony with them shall not spede.<br />
